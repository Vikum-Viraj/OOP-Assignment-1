Question1
 
You are going to design a program, which calculates room charges for a certain hotel. The room types 
available are Delux-Double, Standard-Family and Standard-Single. The room charge depends on the facilities 
required. 
Design a RoomChargeCalculator class with the following methods. 
Method getChargeDeluxDouble that accepts the true/false for the following parameters. 
balcony, parking, tv, kitchen, wifi 
Use the following details to calculate the fee. 
Fixed fee = 5000 
Additional chargers if the following were requested, 
Balcony – 500 
Parking – 200 
Tv -200 
Kitchen – 1000 
Wifi - 100 
Method getChargeStandardFamily that accepts the true/false for the following parameters. 
parking, kitchen, garden 
Use the following details to calculate the fee. 
Fixed fee = 3000 
Additional chargers if the following were requested, 
Parking – 200 
Kitchen – 500 garden 
- 200 
Method getChargeStandardSingle that accepts the true/false for the following parameters. 
parking, ac, wifi 
Use the following details to calculate the fee. 
Fixed fee = 2000 
Additional chargers if the following were requested, 
Parking – 200 Ac 
– 500 
wifi – 100 
write a program, which displays the following menu and responds to the user's selection: 
Room Charge Calculator 
1. Delux-Double 
2. Standard-Family 
3. Standard-Single 
4. Quit 
Enter your choice (1-4): 
Display an error message if the user enters a number outside the range of 1 through 4 when selecting an item 
from the menu.



Question 2 

Implement a class named RandNum. The class should have a 5x5 2D array of 25 integers. The constructor 
should use the random() function to generate a random number in the range of 1 to 100 for each element in 
the array. 
Implement a method to calculate the minimum, maximum and average of the 25 values. 
Implement a method to display the values of the array, minimum, maximum and average of the 25 values. 
Implement a class called MyMain with the main method and demonstrate the RandNum class.
